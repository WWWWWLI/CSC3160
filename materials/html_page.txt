				The difference between speech and language processing and other data processing is the use of knowledge
				of language. In this course, we will study how to describe, process and compute different levels of
				language knowledge including Phonetics and Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and how the
				language knowledge is used in speech and language applications such as named entities recognition,
				information extraction, question answering, speech recognition, and speech synthesis.

			<h2><b>Course Information</b></h2>
			<hr />
			<div id="coursedesc">
				<p>
					This course is designed as the first course for students who are interested in speech and language
					technology. The first half of the course focuses on the fundamentals and introduces tools for
					students to use, and the second half emphasises on applications, giving students the opportunity to
					know how speech and language technology could impact human life.

					In particular, the topics include:
				<ul>
					<li> Understanding human speech: spectrogram, fundamental frequency, formant, etc </li>
					<li> Human sounds and their organization </li>
					<li> Words and their relationship to other words </li>
					<li> Syntax: Structure of sentences </li>
					<li> Text processing and regular expressions </li>
					<li> Language models </li>
					<li> Embedding: Representations of the meaning of words </li>
					<li> Word classifications and Named entities recognition </li>
					<li> Applications: speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, chatbot, etc</li>
				</ul>

				</p>

			<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Proficiency in LaTex: </b> All the reports need to be written by using LaTex. A template will be
					provided. If you are not familiar with LaTex, please learn from the <a
						href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials" target="_blank">tutorial</a> in advance.
				</li>
				<li><b>Proficiency in GitHub: </b> All the source codes need to be submitted in GitHub. </li>
				<li><b>Proficiency in Python:</b> All the assignments will be in Python (using Numpy and <a
						href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank">PyTorch</a>). </li>
				<li><b>Basic machine learning knowledge: </b> It is possible to take this course without any machine
					learning knowledge, however, the course will be easier if you have foundations of machine learning.
				</li>
				<li><b>Basic Concepts of probability: </b> It will be easier for you to understand some lectures if you
					know basics of probability. </li>
			</ul>
